## How it works

This project counts in binary from 0 - 7 and converts it to the outputs for a 7-segment display with the push of a button.  

## How to test

Reset the counter by pulling pin 0 high, and add one to the counter by pulling the clock pin high. You should see the 7-segment display increment by one on each press of the button.   

## External hardware

Two buttons and a single 7-segment display.
